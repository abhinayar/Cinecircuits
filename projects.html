                                <span>While the</span> Cannes Film Festival is today regarded as the premier event for showcasing works of international cinema, its incipient years were much more humble. During the inaugural festival in 1939, a total of seven films from five different countries (all of which were either produced in Europe or the United States) were screened. By 1949, despite being hinder by the turmoil of the Second World War and a number of budgetary problems, the scope of the festival increased dramatically to encompass 29 films from 12 different countries. This event featured entries from Mexico, Argentina, Egypt, and Serbia, provides a snapshot of the festival’s increasing global reach.

                                <span>By 1962,</span> a total of five continents were represented (excluding Australia) and the number of entries had grown to 37 films. Most importantly, however, the amount of films being exhibited outside of the United States/European network had reached approximately 35% and included entries from Japan, Hong Kong, Senegal, Congo, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, India, and Israel.

                                <span>Formed on</span> June 6, 1930 in Brussels, FIPRESCI (abbreviated from Fédération Internationale de la Presse Cinématographique) is the preeminent professional association uniting film journalists around the globe. Throughout its history FIPRESCI has provided a platform for sharing and information about film distribution between nations. Its founding signifies the first concerted effort to expand the global reach of film criticism. According to the statutes of FIPRESCI’s constitution it aspired to “encourage the exchange of ideas and experience among film critics and film journalists of all countries and thereby create, outside all ideological and political distinctions, a new foundation for a permanent dialogue.”

                                <br/>
                                <span>In the</span> wake of the Second World War and in conjunction with the second Cannes Film Festival in 1946, the Federation began convening juries to award the FIPRESCI Prize (also known as the International Film Critics Award) at various international festivals in order to “promote film-art and to encourage new and young cinema.”
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <span>Since the</span> inception of the prize in 1946, the number of festivals that FIPRESCI jurors have attended has risen considerably—from a handful of exclusively European events to those spread across six continents. The increasing prominence of the prize is commensurate with the explosive proliferation of film festivals into the 21 st century.
